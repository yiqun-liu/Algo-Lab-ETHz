# Personal Solutions (Algo-Lab@ETHz, HS19)

I write code at computer rooms and also on my laptop, so I created this repo mainly to sync my working environment. (At least for now, I have no time to keep the repo 'tidy' and my codes sufficiently readable.)

All final version codes have passed online judge (If there are several versions of solution, the one suffixed by greatest number is the final version).



## Index

### Week 1

Introduction & **precomputing** (e. g. partial sum)

### Problem of the Week (PotW)

1.  Deck of Cards (Sliding Window)
2. Attack of the Clones (Greedy, intricate details)
3.  Cantonal Courier (Maximum network flow, hard to model it as flow problem)
4.  Suez (Linear programming)
5.  Golden Eye (Delaunay triangulation & Union Find)



### Online Judge

Some personal experience

- A non-void function without a return statement works fine on my own PC, but sometimes caused a TL in OJ
  - if OJ result is not as expected, compile with `-Wall` option
- C's `qsort` once caused a 'forbidden'. However, C++'s `std::sort` works fine...



## TODO

- PotW - "From Russia With Love" (also TA's idea)

- Rewrite PotW - "Attack of the Clones" using Yu Fei's idea
- Use binary search to accelerate W7 - radiation
- TA's comment on "london" --> README
