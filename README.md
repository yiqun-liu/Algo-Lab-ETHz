# Personal Solutions (Algo-Lab@ETHz, HS19)

I write code at computer rooms and also on my laptop, so I created this repo mainly to sync my working environment. (At least for now, I have no time to keep the repo 'tidy' and my codes sufficiently readable.)

All public codes has passed online judge.

Some personal experience

- A non-void function without a return statement works fine on my own PC, but sometimes caused a TL in OJ
  - always compile with `-Wall` option
- C's `qsort` once caused a 'forbidden'. However, C++'s `std::sort` works fine...
