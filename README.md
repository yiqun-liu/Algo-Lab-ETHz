4.  Suez (Linear programming)
5.  Golden Eye (Delaunay triangulation & Union Find)



### Online Judge

Some personal experience

- A non-void function without a return statement works fine on my own PC, but sometimes caused a TL in OJ
  - if OJ result is not as expected, compile with `-Wall` option
- C's `qsort` once caused a `forbidden` error. However, C++'s `std::sort` always works fine...
- When your needs a lot of memory, use `std::vector` instead of C's array



## TODO

- PotW - "From Russia With Love" (also TA's idea)

- Rewrite PotW - "Attack of the Clones" using Yu Fei's idea
- Use binary search to accelerate W7 - radiation
