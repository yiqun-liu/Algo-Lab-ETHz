# Personal Solutions (Algo-Lab@ETHz, HS19)

I write code at computer rooms and also on my laptop, so I created this repo mainly to sync my working environment. (At least for now, I have no time to keep the repo 'tidy' and my codes sufficiently readable.)

All public codes have passed online judge.



## TODO

- Upload previous codes & notes

- Rewrite PotW - "Attack of the Clones" using Yu Fei's idea
- Use binary search to accelerate W7 - radiation
- Implement TA's idea, "From Russia With Love"

Solving graph problem using BGL library: **Maximum Flows**

- Coin Tossing (A variation of "Soccer Prediction" in the Slides)
- Shopping Trip (Edge Disjoint Paths)
- Tetris (Edge Disjoint Paths)

### Problem of the Week (PotW)

1.  TODO
2. Attack of the Clones (Greedy, intricate details)

### Online Judge

Some personal experience

- A non-void function without a return statement works fine on my own PC, but sometimes caused a TL in OJ
  - always compile with `-Wall` option
- C's `qsort` once caused a 'forbidden'. However, C++'s `std::sort` works fine...
